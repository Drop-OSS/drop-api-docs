# Drop API Documentation

Use the Drop API to interact with Drop-instances, on a per-instance level, to build third-party integrations and applications. Drop is built with an API-first development model, which means the API can do nearly anything users can, and more. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, you will need to decide on the type of application you are building. Drop has two sets of APIs:

- **Web API**: interaction with most of the application, used for management and integration.
- **Client API**: a specific subset of APIs, plus additional APIs used to do client-only actions, like download content and networking features.

Then, use the associated authentication mechanism to authenticate with Drop.
