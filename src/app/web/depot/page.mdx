# Depot API

The depot API is a common layout for all endpoints that offer content downloads for Drop. It's designed to be flexible to allow almost any arrangement of depot types.

## Notes

Some implementation decisions around depots may seem strange, but depots are designed to:

- operate over HTTP
- enforce access control (only Drop users can download)
- be static (no server-side logic)

## Setting up a depot

The Drop instance generates an encryption key, used to encrypt content files. This key, called the **depot key**, is shared with clients so they can decrypt their downloads. This is similar to how Steam's download system operates.
